"""
teach you how to process files, use command-line arguments, and handle text line by line.


1Ô∏è‚É£ import sys
We import the sys module because it gives access to command-line arguments and the sys.exit() function.
sys.argv ‚Üí a list of all command-line arguments (e.g., ["lines.py", "hello.py"]).
sys.exit() ‚Üí immediately stops the program, optionally printing an error message.

2Ô∏è‚É£ def main():
We define a main function for organization and control flow.
You should always wrap your core logic inside main() ‚Äî it keeps your code modular and testable.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Command-line argument check
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    sys.exit("Too few or too many command-line arguments")

len(sys.argv) counts how many arguments the user entered.
The first argument (sys.argv[0]) is always the filename itself (lines.py).
So the user should pass exactly one additional argument (the target file to analyze).

4Ô∏è‚É£ File extension validation
if not filename.endswith(".py"):
    sys.exit("Not a Python file")

Here we use the string method .endswith(), which checks the file name‚Äôs suffix.
If it‚Äôs not a Python file, the program stops immediately.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Opening and reading the file safely
with open(filename) as file:

This uses a context manager (with) to open the file.
It automatically closes the file after finishing.
file becomes a file object that you can iterate through line by line.
üí° Python concept:
Using with open(...) is preferred over manual open() and close() ‚Äî safer and cleaner.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Looping through lines
for line in file:
    stripped = line.strip()

Each iteration reads one line from the file.
.strip() removes all leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).

7Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering blank lines and comments
if not stripped or stripped.startswith("#"):
    continue

Here‚Äôs the logic:
not stripped ‚Üí catches empty lines (after removing whitespace, nothing remains).
.startswith("#") ‚Üí identifies comment lines, optionally preceded by spaces.
üí° Why not count docstrings as comments?
Because docstrings (triple-quoted strings inside functions/classes) are code, not comments ‚Äî the spec explicitly says not to exclude them.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Handle missing files
except FileNotFoundError:
    sys.exit("File does not exist")

If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, Python raises a FileNotFoundError, which we catch gracefully.
üí° Python concept:
This is called exception handling.
You use try / except blocks to catch and handle predictable errors instead of letting your program crash.

üîü The program entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

When the file runs directly (python lines.py file.py), this block calls main().
But if it‚Äôs imported as a module (like import lines), it doesn‚Äôt execute main() automatically.


Python Concepts Learned
Concept	Explanation
sys.argv	Access command-line arguments
sys.exit()	Stop execution with a message
with open(...)	Safe file handling context manager
.strip()	Remove whitespace from both ends of a string
.startswith()	Check the prefix of a string
try / except	Error handling structure
FileNotFoundError	Specific error type for missing files
continue	Skip to the next loop iteration
if __name__ == "__main__":	Prevent code from running on import
raise vs sys.exit	Raise creates an exception; exit terminates program
