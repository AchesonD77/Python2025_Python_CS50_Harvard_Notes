"""
the cookie Jar class plus a solid pytest suite.

Classes & state: Jar encapsulates state (_size, _capacity) and behavior (methods).
The leading underscore is a Python convention for ‚Äúinternal‚Äù attributes.

__init__: the constructor validates inputs up front, a best practice to keep objects always-valid.

__str__: defines the human-readable representation. Repeating a string with * is a Pythonic way to render n cookies

Defensive checks: both deposit and withdraw validate type and domain (non-negative, within capacity/availability)
and raise ValueError on violations‚Äîexactly what the spec expects.

Properties: @property exposes read-only attributes so users can access jar.size
and jar.capacity like fields, but you keep control internally.

What @property does
@property turns a method into an attribute-like getter.
With it, you can write jar.capacity (not jar.capacity()),
but under the hood Python calls the function to compute/return the value.

So in our class:
self._capacity and self._size are the internal (‚Äúprivate-ish‚Äù) fields.
The leading underscore is a Python convention: ‚Äúthis is for internal use.‚Äù

capacity and size are the public read-only attributes that expose those values safely.
